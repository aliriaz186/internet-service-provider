                Effective as of April 2021<br>
                <br>

                Eagle Internet is dedicated to keeping your personal information secure and out of the hands of anyone other than Eagle Internet. Please read below to learn more about Eagle Internet’s Privacy Policy. By using the Service (as defined in the Customer’s Service Agreement) or accessing the Eagle Internet website in any manner, Customer acknowledges that Customer accepts the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and Customer hereby consents that Eagle Internet will collect, use, and share Customer’s Personal Information in the following ways. (Can be found at www.eagleinternetservices.com)<br>
                Remember that Customer’s use of the Service is at all times subject to Customer’s Service Agreement, which incorporates this Privacy Policy by reference. Customer’s use of the Eagle Internet website is at all times subject to Eagle Internet Website Terms of Use. Any capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy will have the same meaning as defined in Customer’s Service Agreement and Website Terms of Use. (Can be found at www.eagleinternetservices.com)<br>
                Eagle Internet Services are designed and targeted to U.S. audiences and are governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of the U.S. If Customer is not a U.S. citizen or do not reside in the U.S., Customer voluntarily consents to the collection, transfer, use, disclosure and retention of Customer Personal Information in the U.S. Customer also agrees to waive any claims that may arise under Customer’s own national laws.<br>
                When Customer uses the Service, the Personal Information (as defined below) Customer sends and receives is transmitted over a wireless network, and may be subject to interception by unauthorized third parties who seek to do you harm. While it is Eagle Internet’s objective to take reasonable measures to reduce the risk that unauthorized third parties will be able to intercept the information Customer sends and receives through the Service, Eagle Internet cannot and does not make any guarantee that transmissions over the Internet are 100% secure or error-free.
                Eagle Internet recommends that Customers use caution when sending any Personal Information over the Internet and use encryption technology whenever possible, such as websites that have the “https” designation in the website’s address bar and show a padlock icon in the browser’s window.<br>
                Eagle Internet does not knowingly collect, solicit or use Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13. If Customer is under age 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any Personal Information about yourself to Eagle Internet. If Eagle Internet learns that Eagle Internet has collected Personal Information from a child under age 13, Eagle Internet will delete that information as quickly as possible to the extent technically feasible. If Customer believes that its child under age 13 may have provided Eagle Internet Personal Information, please contact Eagle Internet at billing@eagleinternetservices@gmail.com.<br>
                <span style="font-weight: bold"> What types of information does this Privacy Policy cover?</span><br>

                Eagle Internet collects various types of information about Customers and Customers’ use of the Service via the Eagle Internet website, Help Desk and call centers, postal mail, remote kiosks, Eagle Internet Facebook Page or other social network platforms or by other means, generally classified as Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.<br>
                Generally, Eagle Internet gathers and uses Personal Information internally in connection with providing the Service to Customer, including to personalize, evaluate and improve the Service and Eagle Internet’s ability to provide the Service to Customer, to contact Customer, to respond to and fulfill Customer requests regarding the Service, and to analyze how Customer uses the Service.<br>
                Eagle Internet may share Customer’s Personal Information with its Affiliates and with other third parties as described below:<br>
                <span style="font-weight: bold">What Information does Eagle Internet collect and how does Eagle Internet use this Information?</span><br>


               <span style="font-weight: bold"> Personal Information</span>
                <br>
                Personal Information is the information Customer provides to Eagle Internet voluntarily or passively through Customer use of the Service and/or website, and which is directly associated with or reasonably linked to a specific person, computer or device. For example, through the registration process, when the equipment to provide the Service is installed, maintained or upgraded at Customer’s premises, when Customer contacts Eagle Internet regarding the Service, and through Customer account settings, Eagle Internet collects Personal Information such as Customer name, email address, phone number, billing address and billing information (such as credit card account number or other financial account information), service address, and the nature of any of Customer devices or other property making use of the Service. Customer may be required to provide certain Personal Information to Eagle Internet in order to register with Eagle Internet or to assist Eagle Internet in improving Customer’s Service or troubleshooting problems Customer is experiencing with the Service, Customer computer or device, or otherwise to improve the quality of the Service.<br>
                Eagle Internet will communicate with Customer if Customer has provided Eagle Internet the means to do so. For example, if Customer has given Eagle Internet Customer’s email address or phone number, Eagle Internet will email or call Customer about Customer use of the Service or product improvements or upgrades, and other transactional information about Customer Service.<br>
                Eagle Internet may also combine Customer Personal Information with additional Personal Information obtained from Eagle Internet Facebook Pages or other social network platforms, its Affiliates, its Operational Service Providers (third party owned companies that provide or perform services on Eagle Internet’s behalf, to help serve Customer better and to perform functions in order to support Eagle Internet businesses and operations), or other companies, such as credit bureaus, background check firms, and marketing research companies.<br>
                Some forms of Non-Personal Information as described below will be classified as Personal Information if required by applicable law or when such information is directly associated with or reasonably linked to a specific person, computer or device, or is combined with other forms of Personal Information.<br>
                <span style="font-weight: bold">   Non-Personal Information</span><br>

                Website Information, Use of Cookies and other Similar Tracking Technology<br>
                When you visits Eagle Internet’s website, Eagle Internet will collect various types of Non-Personal Information, such as information on Eagle Internet’s server logs from Customer’s browser or device, which may include Customer IP address, unique device identifier, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access the Service, and the page or feature Customer requested. (IP Address and device identifiers are traditionally classified as Non-Personal Information, unless Eagle Internet is required to do so otherwise under applicable law.) “Cookies” and “web beacons” are text file identifiers “transfers to Customer’s browser or device that allow Eagle Internet to recognize Customer’s browser or device and tell Eagle Internet how and when pages and features on the Eagle Internet website are visited, by how many people, and other activity on the website.<br>
                Customer can change the preferences on Customer’s browser or device to prevent or limit Customer’s device’s acceptance of cookies, web beacons or other similar technology, but this may prevent Customer from taking advantage of some of the features on the Eagle Internet website, or accessing certain functions and conveniences. If Customer clicks on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to Customer. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies or other such tracking technology by any third parties, and Eagle Internet is not responsible for their privacy policies and practices.<br>
                Eagle Internet also uses Personal Information and Non-Personal Information to enhance the Eagle Internet website and Eagle Internet Service offerings. For example, such information can tell Eagle Internet how often visitors use a particular feature of the Eagle Internet website and which products and services are most interesting to current and potential customers, and Eagle Internet can use that knowledge to make the website useful and interesting to as many users as possible and to enhance and refine Eagle Internet’s Service offerings. Eagle Internet will continue to conduct analytics on Eagle Internet website performance; Customer may not opt-out of this use of cookies or other Personal Information or Non-Personal Information.<br>
                Technology is improving every day and to improve Eagle Internet’s Services’ operation and function Eagle Internet may introduce new technologies and monitoring techniques without advance notice or consent from Customer.
                Eagle Internet may also use third party providers to conduct such internal analyses.<br>
                <span style="font-weight: bold">   Network Information</span><br>


                Eagle Internet also collects Network Information, information about Customer access to, and use of, the Eagle Internet network, which may or may not be directly associated with or reasonably linked to a specific person, computer or device. For example, Eagle Internet may collect information about the performance of the Provider Equipment installed on Customer property or at Customer premises, when Customer is using the Service, the various devices Customer is using to access the Service, the amount of data Customer is transmitting and receiving, the content of the data Customer are transmitting and receiving, the websites Customer is visiting, and any other information that is transmitted over the Eagle Internet network. Eagle Internet may also aggregate Network Information from multiple subscribers and Eagle Internet will share such aggregated Non-Personal information about the overall performance of the Eagle Internet Service and network with Our Affiliates and other third parties. Aggregated information does not identify a specific individual, computer or device.<br>
                We use Network Information to monitor and enhance the performance of the Eagle Internet network. Eagle Internet will not monitor the content of the websites viewed or email communications as part of Eagle Internet’s standard network management. Generally, Eagle Internet will only monitor and preserve the following Network Information:<br>

               <ul>
                <li>When Customer is using the Service;</li>
                <li>

                    How Customer is using the Service, such as monitoring traffic patterns regarding websites visited, amount of data being sent or received, or other activity;

                </li>
                <li>

                    The amount of data Customer is transmitting and receiving through the Service; and
                </li>
                <li>

                    General information regarding the performance of the Provider Equipment installed on Customer’s property or at Customer’s premises, and its interaction with the rest of Eagle Internet’s network. However, Eagle Internet reserves the right to, and may, monitor, access, review and preserve any Network Information and/or content in the following situations:

                </li>
                <li>

                    In response to an inquiry from Customer or an another Authorized User on Customer’s account regarding Customer or their use of the Service or problems Customer or they are experiencing using the Service;
                </li>
                <li>

                    If Eagle Internet has reason to believe Customer is using the Service in violation of Customer’s Service Agreement or any applicable statutes, rules, ordinances or regulations;
                </li>
                <li>

                    If Eagle Internet has reason to believe Customer use of the Service is negatively affecting other Customers; or
                </li>
                <li>

                    If Eagle Internet has reason to believe Customer use of the Service is negatively affecting other Customers; or
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">
                How is Personal Information used for marketing and advertising purposes?
            </span><br>



            Eagle Internet will use Personal Information to send Customer marketing and advertising messages related to Eagle Internet’s Service and website using Customer’s email address, postal address, or telephone number (for voice, texts, and pre-recorded calls). Eagle Internet may deliver a marketing or advertising message based on Customer visits to Eagle Internet website, which will be general advertising or “Contextual Advertising,” which is advertising based on the subject matter or the content of the specific website page or subject matter. Eagle Internet may also send Customer “First Party Advertising,” which is advertising that is customized or personalized based on a history of Customer’s use of our Services (possibly combined with information from our Facebook fan page or other social network platforms). First Party Advertising is based solely on a combination of information Eagle Internet collects from Customer – not from Customer’s visits to other websites across the Internet.<br>
            Customer may opt-out of First Party Advertising but not Contextual Advertising. No Personal Information is used to deliver Contextual Advertising; it automatically will appear based on the content or webpage Customer is viewing. And Customer may continue to receive general advertising if Customer opts-out of First Party Advertising, it will not be customized or personalized for Customer.<br>
            Eagle Internet does not provide third party “Network Advertising,” which is advertising based on Customer’s overall Internet usage across different third party websites or online services. Multiple third party websites and online services are involved in this tailored or personalized advertising process, in essence a “network” of advertising providers.<br>
            Because Eagle Internet does not provide network ads, Eagle Internet does not recognize the “Do Not Track” settings on various Internet browsers. Eagle Internet does not engage or allow third parties to track you across the Internet and across time for advertising purposes.<br>
           <span style="font-weight: bold">Links to other websites or online services</span>
            <br>
            The Eagle Internet website and/or Facebook Pages (or other social networking platforms) may contain a variety of content and functionality and may provide links to other third party websites or online services. Despite such links, this Privacy Policy applies only to Eagle Internet and our Affiliates. The presence of a link does not constitute or imply Eagle Internet’s endorsement, recommendation, or sponsorship of the content, goods, services, business or privacy practices on such websites or online services. Eagle Internet encourages Customers to be aware and informed when Customers leave Eagle Internet’s website and Eagle Internet’s Facebook Pages, or any other social networking platforms.<br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Will Eagle Internet share Customer Personal Information?</span><br>
            Customer’s Personal Information will only be disclosed to third parties (including Eagle Internet’s Affiliates) as listed in this Privacy Policy, if Eagle Internet has received your consent at the time Eagle Internet will collect your Personal Information or prior to the disclosure of any Personal Information. Eagle Internet reserves the right to fully use, disclose and process any Non-Personal Information collected from Customer in any manner as well as any information Customer makes public via Eagle Internet Services or website.<br>
            Eagle Internet will not rent, sell or disclose Personal Information to anyone not related to Eagle Internet for marketing or promotional purposes, unless in connection with a potential or actual sale, merger or a corporate restructuring by or of Eagle Internet. (See “For Business Transfers” below for more information.) Eagle Internet will share Customer Personal Information with its Affiliates and with other third parties as described in this section for the following reasons:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>To Our Affiliates. Eagle Internet relies on various Affiliates in order to provide the Service to Customers. These are companies that are related to Eagle Internet by common ownership or control. Eagle Internet may share Personal Information and Non-Personal Information with any of its Affiliates for business, operational, promotional and/or marketing and advertising purposes.</li>
                <li>To Operational Service Providers: Eagle Internet and its Affiliates contract with other companies and people to perform tasks or services on Eagle Internet’s behalf and need to share Customer Personal Information to provide products or services to Customers. For example, Eagle Internet may use a payment processing company to receive and process Customer’s ACH or credit card transactions for Eagle Internet, or Eagle Internet may contract with third parties to assist Eagle Internet in optimizing Eagle Internet’s network. Unless Eagle Internet tells Customer differently, Eagle Internet does not grant its Operational Service Providers any right to use the Personal Information Eagle Internet shares with them beyond what is necessary to assist Eagle Internet.</li>
                <li>
                    For Business Transfers/Restructuring: Eagle Internet may choose to buy or sell assets, or Eagle Internet may sell assets or be sold. In these types of transactions, customer Personal Information is typically one of the business assets that would be disclosed and transferred. Also, if Eagle Internet (or Eagle Internet’s assets) are acquired, or Eagle Internet goes out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, including restructuring, re-organization or financing arrangements, Personal Information could be one of the assets disclosed, transferred to or acquired by a third party.

                </li>
                <li>
                     For Protection of Eagle Internet, and Our Affiliates, Employees, Operational Service Providers, Users and Subscribers and Public Safety: Eagle Internet reserves the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any Personal Information Eagle Internet has access to if Eagle Internet believes doing so will implement and/or enforce the Service Agreement, Website Terms of Use Agreement, Privacy Policy or any legal document; protect our Network(s), website(s), and company assets; protect the interests, rights, property, and/or safety of Eagle Internet or Our Affiliates, employees and officers/directors, Operational Service Providers, Users and Subscribers, agents, third party licensors or suppliers, or the general public.

                </li>
                <li>
                     When Required by Law or in Response to Legal Process: Eagle Internet reserves the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any Personal Information to which Eagle Internet has access if Eagle Internet is required by law or legal process to do so, or if Eagle Internet has a good faith belief that Eagle Internet is required by law or legal process to do so.

                </li>
            </ul>

            <span style="font-weight: bold">
                            Is Customer Personal Information secure?
            </span><br>
            Eagle Internet endeavors to protect the privacy of Customer’s account and other Personal Information Eagle Internet holds in its records using reasonable administrative, technical and physical security measures. However, Eagle Internet cannot and do not guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of Personal Information at any time.<br>
            Customer’s account is protected by a password for Customer privacy and security. It is Customer’s responsibility to prevent unauthorized access to Customer’s account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting Customer password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to Customer computer, tablet or device and browser by signing off after Customer has finished accessing Customer’s account. Customer is required to notify us immediately if Customer’s password or account has been disclosed to a person whose name does not appear on Customer’s account, even if you have allowed such disclosure. Customer understands, acknowledges and agrees that Customer is solely responsible for any use of Eagle Internet via Customer’s username and password.<br>
            Additionally, if Customer contacts Eagle Internet, Eagle Internet will ask Customer for verification of Customer’s identification and account. Eagle Internet will not send an email or text, nor should Customer respond to any email or text communications asking for any sensitive or confidential Personal Information, such as social security number, bank account or credit card account number, or a driver’s license number. If Customer receives an email or text requesting any such information from Eagle Internet or someone that claims they are with Eagle Internet or Our Affiliates please contact our Privacy Administrator immediately: billing@eagleinternetservices.com.<br>
            For Eagle Internet’s IT Support Services as detailed in our Service Agreement, the code that allows Eagle Internet to access Customer’s computer desktop to help your resolve technical problems is limited only for that specific session. Eagle Internet is not able to access Customer’s Computer without Customer’s knowledge, affirmative consent and involvement.<br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">
                            What Personal Information can Customers access, modify and/or delete?

            </span><br>
            Generally, Customer may access the following Personal Information in Customer’s account:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Full name
                </li>
                <li>
                    Username and password
                </li>
                <li>
                    Email address
                </li>
                <li>
                    Telephone number; and
                </li>
                <li>
                    Billing and Service address
                </li>
                <li>
                    Account and billing information
                </li>
            </ul><br>
            By contacting Eagle Internet at billing@eagleinternetservices.com, or through any online access portal Eagle Internet may create to enable Customers to view and modify Customer account settings, Customer may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the Personal Information listed above. For example, Eagle Internet may retain historic email, billing and/or Service addresses for security and verification purposes. Customer may not delete such information.
            When Customer updates Personal Information, however, Eagle Internet may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in Eagle Internet’s records for internal security reasons and record keeping. Some information may remain in Eagle Internet’s records after it is modified, amended or deleted by Customer or Eagle Internet. Eagle Internet may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating Customer’s Personal Information after Customer updates or deletes it, but not in a manner that would identify Customer personally. Eagle Internet may also maintain Personal Information regarding Customer and Customer’s use of the Service after Customer are no longer a Eagle Internet customer as required by Eagle Internet’s business practices, by law, and/or tax reporting purposes.
            The information Customer can view, update, and delete may also change. If Customer has any questions about viewing or updating information Eagle Internet has on file about Customer, please contact Eagle Internet at billing@eagleinternetservices.com.
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">
                            What third party disclosure choices do Customers have?
            </span>
            <br>
            Customer can always choose not to disclose Personal Information to Eagle Internet; however, certain Personal Information is necessary for Eagle Internet to provide the Service to Customer. Customer may opt out of sharing Personal Information with Our Affiliates only for marketing or advertising purposes, but not for business or operational purposes.<br>
            Customer may opt out of email marketing and advertising from Eagle Internet or its Affiliates using the “Unsubscribe” mechanism in each email. Before Eagle Internet sends Customer a text for any reason, or sends Customer a pre-recorded call that contains advertising or marketing information, Eagle Internet will secure Customer’s prior written express consent, which can be given via a voice recording, email, text message, postal mail, or telephone key press. Non-telemarketing pre-recorded calls do not require Customer’s prior express consent in writing, unless they are sent to a wireless device. Customer understands, acknowledges and agrees that such texts and pre-recorded telemarketing calls may be sent using an autodialer and are not conditioned on your purchase of the Service. Customer may opt out of receiving text messages any time by replying “STOP” or “UNSUBSCRIBE” to the text message. Customer may opt out of receiving pre-recorded calls by the opt-out instructions in the call. Customer can also request to be added to Eagle Internet’s company-specific Do Not Call list to opt-out of advertising and marketing calls of all types. However, Customer will continue to receive calls related to debt-collection and Customer’s current Service. Customer may also opt-out of First Party Advertising, but not Contextual Advertising, as detailed in the “Use of Personal Information for Marketing or Advertising Purposes” section above.<br>
            Customer may not opt out of Eagle Internet’s use of cookies or other similar technology, or use of Customer’s Personal Information and Non-Personal Information for Eagle Internet’s internal analytics used to monitor activity on Eagle Internet’s website, measure Eagle Internet performance, or to operate and protect the Eagle Internet network.<br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold"> Will this Privacy Policy ever change?</span><br>

            Yes, Eagle Internet is constantly working to improve the Service, so Eagle Internet will need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time as Eagle Internet’s business practices change and service offerings increase, and/or there are changes in local, state or federal laws. Additionally, Eagle Internet will also make stylistic, organizational and/or grammatical changes to present Eagle Internet privacy practices in a user friendly easy to read manner. Eagle Internet will alert Customers to any such changes by placing a notice on www.eagleinternetservices.com with the effective date of the revised Privacy Policy, and/or by sending Customers an email, or by some other means to the extent required by law. Please note that if Customers have not provided Eagle Internet with Customer’s email address or Customer has not updated Customer contact information, those legal notices will still govern Customer use of the Service, and Customer is still responsible for reading and understanding all notices posted on Eagle Internet’s website. Customer’s continued use of the Service or website after notice of any changes have been provided will indicate Customer’s acceptance of such changes, except where further steps are required by applicable law.<br>
            Use of Customer’s Personal Information is primarily governed by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time Customer subscribed to the Service or visited the Eagle Internet website. If Eagle Internet elects to use or to disclose Personal Information that identifies Eagle Internet as an individual in a manner that is materially different than that stated in the Privacy Policy in effect at the time you subscribed to the Service or visited the Eagle Internet website, Eagle Internet will provide Customer with an opportunity to consent to such use or disclosure. Depending on the circumstances, that consent may include an opt out.<br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">
                            What if you have questions or comments about this Privacy Policy?
            </span><br>
