                        <h3>Guaranteed Minimum Speeds</h3>
                        <p>

                            Many services advertise fast speeds and low prices. When you call for technical support for slow speeds they let you know that those are ``up to`` speeds and that they can't help you. We offer guaranteed minimum speeds that range from 75% to 100% of the maximum rate. There is a reason why we guarantee minimum speeds and most our competitors don't.

                        </h3>
                        <p>

                            We don't outsource technical support to foreign based call centers. Our technical support representatives work alongside our engineers and network monitoring personnel. In most cases if there is a network problem they will know. That means they can let you know and give an estimated time for repair instead of following a script that starts with you rebooting your computers and routers.

                        </h3>
                        <p>

                            We proactively monitor 6 key performance areas on every customer radio. The data is collected every minute and stored for at least 6 months. Our engineers use this data to proactively correct problems and fine tune our network. In the rare case that you do need to call in for a problem, our technical support team will have access to performance data for your radio that in most cases help them quickly identify the problem and possible solutions.
